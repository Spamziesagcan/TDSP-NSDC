## üîç Objective:

To analyze and visualize transportation patterns, identify peak travel times, and segment passengers using clustering methods to help optimize public transport operations and strategies.

## üìÅ Dataset Description:

CRASH\_DATE and CRASH\_TIME: Date and time of the crash

BOROUGH: The NYC borough where the crash occurred

ZIP\_CODE: ZIP code of the crash

LATITUDE, LONGITUDE: Coordinates for geospatial analysis

LOCATION: Combined lat-long

ON\_STREET\_NAME, CROSS\_STREET\_NAME, OFF\_STREET\_NAME

NUMBER\_OF\_PERSONS\_INJURED, NUMBER\_OF\_PERSONS\_KILLED

NUMBER\_OF\_PEDESTRIANS\_INJURED, NUMBER\_OF\_PEDESTRIANS\_KILLED

NUMBER\_OF\_CYCLIST\_INJURED, NUMBER\_OF\_CYCLIST\_KILLED

NUMBER\_OF\_MOTORIST\_INJURED, NUMBER\_OF\_MOTORIST\_KILLED

CONTRIBUTING\_FACTOR\_VEHICLE\_X: Suspected causes of crash

VEHICLE\_TYPE\_CODE\_X: Type of vehicle involvedThe data has been cleaned, processed, and formatted for analysis.

## üìä Technologies & Libraries Used:

- Python 3.8+
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
- scikit-learn
- datetime

## üß† Methodology:

1. Data Preprocessing:

   - Handling missing values
   - Parsing and extracting date/time features

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

   - Travel volume trends by time
   - Route and station popularity
   - Passenger segmentation

3. Clustering:

   - Used KMeans algorithm
   - Elbow method to determine optimal clusters
   - PCA for visualizing clusters

4. Visualization:

   - Time series plots
   - Route heatmaps
   - Cluster scatter plots

## üìà Key Findings:

- Peak travel occurs during rush hours (morning & evening)
- Certain stations serve as transport hubs
- KMeans clusters revealed diverse travel behavior patterns
- Insights can inform public transport scheduling and fare models

## üõ† How to Run:
